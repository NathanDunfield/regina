<h1><a name="contents">Regina for Ubuntu:  Intrepid (Ubuntu 8.10)</a></h1>

<div class="warning">
<p>
<b>Warning:</b>
Ubuntu has now removed almost all of KDE 3 from their distribution,
including in particular the KDE 3.x documentation viewer.  This
means that you will not be able to access the users' handbook or
the Python reference through Regina's Help menu.
<br>
<br>
You can always view the users' handbook online at
<a href="http://regina.sourceforge.net/docs/">http://regina.sourceforge.net/docs/</a>,
or you can download it in HTML format from the usual place at
<a href="http://regina.sourceforge.net/">http://regina.sourceforge.net/</a>.
The Python reference can be installed directly in HTML format by
installing the package <tt>regina-normal-doc</tt>.
</p></div>
<p>
Ubuntu packages for Regina are not distributed from the SourceForge site.
</p>
<p>
Instead, users of Intrepid Ibex (the Ubuntu 8.10 release) may obtain
packages from the repository on people.debian.org.  These packages
are available for the <b>i386</b> and <b>amd64</b> architectures.
To install them:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
   Add Regina's location to your list of repositories.
   </p>
   <p>
   This only needs to be done once (the first time you install Regina).
   Open the Synaptic package manager, select
   <i>Settings</i>-&gt;<i>Repositories</i>, click on the tab for
   third-party software and add a new repository.  Synaptic will
   ask you for an APT line, which is:
   </p>
   <div class="example"><p>
   <tt>deb http://people.debian.org/~bab/regina/ intrepid main</tt>
   </p></div>
   <p>
   You should also enable the Community Maintained Universe in your
   list of repositories if this has not been done before.
   </p>
   </li>
<li><p>
   Update the list of available packages.
   </p>
   <p>
   This lets your package manager know that a new version of Regina is
   available.  Synaptic users can do this by pressing the Reload button.
   </p>
   </li>
<li><p>
   Install or upgrade Regina like you would any other package.
   </p>
   <p>
   The main package to install is called <tt>regina-normal</tt> (though
   there are others; see below).  Synaptic users will find this
   package in the Mathematics (universe) section.
   </p>
   <p>
   At this point your package manager should download and install Regina
   along with any necessary dependencies.
   </p>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
Regina is split into several packages for Ubuntu.  To start
with you will probably just want the <tt>regina-normal</tt> package.
If you are doing Python scripting and/or compiling Regina's mathematical core
into your own code, you may want the <tt>regina-normal-dev</tt> and
<tt>regina-normal-doc</tt> packages also.  The
<tt>regina-normal-mpi</tt> package is available for users running long
census calculations on clusters.
</p>
<p>
You might have noticed that Intrepid Ibex already offers Regina as part of its
universe section.  However, this is the older version 4.5 (which was current
when Intrepid Ibex was released).  For a newer version of Regina you should
follow the steps outlined above.
