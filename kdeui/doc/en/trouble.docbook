     The <userinput>./configure</userinput> script complains that it
     cannot find <literal>libgmp</literal>, <literal>libxml2</literal>,

    </para></question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      An error such as this means that you are probably missing the
      development files for a library that you need.  If the warning
      is regarding <literal>libfoo</literal>, look
      for a package such as <literal>foo-devel</literal>,
      <literal>libfoo-devel</literal>, <literal>foo-dev</literal> or
      some similar variation that you can install.  These development
      packages contain headers and other files that the compiler needs
      in order to link against the corresponding library.
     </para>
     <para>
      For the three examples above, &debian; users would need to install
      the packages <literal>libgmp3-dev</literal>,
      <literal>libxml2-dev</literal> and <literal>libjpeg62-dev</literal>.
      &rhfedora; users would need to install the packages
      <literal>gmp-devel</literal>, <literal>libxml2-devel</literal>
      and <literal>libjpeg-devel</literal>.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you know you have the appropriate library development files
      installed and you are still seeing this error, it might be that
      the <userinput>./configure</userinput> script simply cannot find them.
      In particular, if the library has been installed in a non-standard
      location, you might need to explicitly pass its location to the
      <userinput>./configure</userinput> script.  As an example, if a
      library is installed beneath <filename>/usr/local</filename>
      with headers in <filename>/usr/local/include</filename> and
      the library itself in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>, you
      can pass the following options:
     </para>
<screen>
<prompt>example:~/source/regina&gt;</prompt> <userinput>./configure
    --with-extra-includes=/usr/local/include
    --with-extra-libs=/usr/local/lib</userinput>
checking build system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
checking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
...
</screen>
     <para>
      Note that some libraries come with their own custom
      <userinput>./configure</userinput> options.  For instance, the
      location of the &qt; installation is specified using the option
      <option>--with-qt-dir</option>, and the location of the
      <filename>libxml2</filename> installation is specified using the
      option <option>--with-xml-prefix</option>.  Run
      <userinput>./configure --help</userinput> for details of all
      available options.

    </para></question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      You will need to install the X development files on your system,
      which are almost certainly available as a package in your
      &linux; distribution.  As an example, &debian; users should install
      the package <literal>xlibs-dev</literal>, &rhel;&nbsp;3 users
      should install <literal>XFree86-devel</literal> and &fedora;&nbsp;2
      users should install <literal>xorg-x11-devel</literal>.
     </para>
     <para>
      Be aware that you will also need the &qt; and &kde; development
      files.  For &debian; users these are in the packages
      <literal>libqt3-mt-dev</literal> and
      <literal>kdelibs4-dev</literal>, and for &rhfedora; users
      these are in the packages <literal>qt-devel</literal> and

      You are missing the &arts; development
      files.  Hopefully your distribution will insist on these being
      installed alongside the &kde; development files, but some
      distributions seem to have unhappily weak package dependencies.
     </para>
     <para>
      To install the missing &arts;
      development files, look for a package such as
      <literal>arts-devel</literal>, <literal>libarts-devel</literal>,
      <literal>libarts-dev</literal> or some similar name.
      For instance, &debian; users should install
      <literal>libarts1-dev</literal>, and &rhfedora; users should
      install <literal>arts-devel</literal>.
     </para>
     <para>
      Some distributions have removed &arts;
      entirely (such as recent &ubuntu; releases, which have migrated
      from &kde3; to &kde4;).  In this case you can happily build
      &regina; without &arts; by passing the configure
      argument <option>--without-arts</option>:

     The compiler complains that it cannot find
     <literal>-lart_lgpl_2</literal>, <literal>-lselinux</literal> or
     <literal>-l...</literal> for some other library.
    </para></question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      This is similar to the
      <link linkend="trouble-devpkgs"><userinput>./configure</userinput>
      problem described earlier</link> regarding missing libraries,
      except that the problem wasn't noticed at
      configuration time.  Again you are probably missing the
      development files for a library that you need.  If the error
      is that the compiler cannot find <literal>-lfoo</literal>, look
      for a package such as <literal>foo-devel</literal>,
      <literal>libfoo-devel</literal>, <literal>foo-dev</literal> or
      some similar variation that you can install.
     </para>
     <para>
      As an example, some &fedora; systems will give the compile error
      "<literal>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lselinux</literal>", which is
      fixed by installing the package <literal>libselinux-devel</literal>.
      Similarly, a failure to find <literal>-lart_lgpl_2</literal> on
      a &rhel; system can be fixed by installing the package
      <literal>libart_lgpl-devel</literal>.

     with complaints of an undeclared identifier.
    </para></question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Look at the error message to see which particular identifier has
      not been declared.  An example of such an error is reproduced
      below, where the undeclared identifier in this case is
      <varname>adjustColumn</varname>.

      If the undeclared identifier is
      <varname>adjustColumn</varname> or
      <varname>SH_Table_GridLineColor</varname>,
      you almost certainly have a &qt; version that is too old.  &regina;
      requires &qt; version 3.2 or higher; trying to compile &regina;
      against &qt; 3.1 will result in errors such as these.

     &regina; refuses to open any topology data files, claiming that an
     appropriate topology data component could not be found.
    </para></question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      It is critical that &regina; be installed in the same location as
      all other &kde; applications on your system.  For instance, if
      &kde; is installed beneath <filename>/opt/kde3</filename> then
      &regina; must be installed there also.
      Errors such as this occur when &regina; has not been installed
      in the same location as &kde;, and thus &kde; cannot find one or
      more of its components.
     </para>
     <para>
      The location in which &regina; is installed is controlled at
      compile-time by passing a <option>--prefix</option> option to the
      <userinput>./configure</userinput> script.  The
      <userinput>./configure</userinput> script will generally guess the
      correct location itself, so in most cases you
      should not be passing your own <option>--prefix</option> at all.
     </para>
     <para>
      However, if you are seeing this problem, working out the correct
      <option>--prefix</option> and then rebuilding and reinstalling
      &regina; will almost certainly fix it.
     </para>
     <para>
      To find which prefix you <emphasis>should</emphasis> be using,
      search for the <userinput>kde-config</userinput> program on your
      system.  Running <userinput>kde-config --prefix</userinput> will
      report the prefix that was used for your &kde; installation.  You
      must then pass this same prefix to <userinput>./configure</userinput>.
     </para>
     <para>
      For instance, if <userinput>kde-config --prefix</userinput>
      reports <computeroutput>/usr</computeroutput> then you should
      start your &regina; build with
      <userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput> as illustrated
      below.

    <question><para>
     I cannot edit a particular packet.  I can view it but I can't change
     anything.
    </para></question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      If a packet has children that need their parent
      to remain constant, it will
      become uneditable.  An example is a triangulation that has a normal
      surface list as a child.  The normal surface list stores coordinates
      based upon the triangulation that created it, so the triangulation
      must remain constant or else the coordinates will become invalid.
     </para>
     <para>
      In such a situation you can try <link linkend="packet-clone">cloning
      the packet</link> without its subtree (<menuchoice>
       <guimenu>Packet Tree</guimenu>
       <guimenuitem>Clone Packet</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>).  The clone will have no children to worry about
      and so should be editable.  Alternatively you could delete the child
      packet that is refusing to allow its parent to change.
     </para>
     <para>
      Note that if a packet cannot be edited because of its children,
      it will be marked with a small padlock in the packet tree.  This is
      illustrated below for the figure eight knot complement.

    <answer>
     <para>
      First, remember that if all else fails you can download
      the handbook in &html; format directly from the &regdownloadsite;,
      or you can simply
      <ulink url="http://regina.sourceforge.net/docs/">read it online</ulink>.

      There are two common causes for this problem:

        <para>
         If you get an error such as &quot;Could not launch the &kde; Help
         Center&quot; or &quot;Could not find khelpcenter executable&quot;,
         you probably do not have the &khelpcenter; installed.  Search your
         &linux; distribution for the <literal>kdebase</literal> package
         (some distributions call this <literal>kdebase3</literal>,
         <literal>kdebase-progs</literal> or
         <literal>kdebase-unified</literal>).
        </para>
        <para>
         Note that you will need the &kde3; version of the &khelpcenter;.
         If your &linux; distribution has moved to &kde4; and no longer
         supports &kde3; (such as recent &ubuntu; releases), you might not
         be able to fix this problem at all.  In this case, your best
         solution is to download the handbook in &html; format or read it
         online, as described above.

       <listitem><para>
        If you get an error such as &quot;There is no documentation available

        handbook installed in the wrong location.
        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem><para>
          If you installed &regina; from a ready-made package, please contact

           If you built &regina; yourself from sources, you need to pass an
           extra argument to the <userinput>./configure</userinput> script.
           Try to find which directory on your system contains the &kde;
           user manuals; typically this is something like
           <filename>/usr/share/doc/kde</filename> or
           <filename>/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML</filename>.  This directory
           should have an <filename>en/</filename> subdirectory, and beneath
           that a subdirectory for each application (such as

      &pdf; packets using whatever program you choose.  &regina; will try
      its best to find a &pdf; viewer on its own if possible
      (in particular, it knows about &kpdf;, &okular;, &xpdf; and &evince;,
      as well as &previewapp; under &macosx;).  However, if your
      installation is unusual then &regina; might need a little help;
      in the &pdf; settings you can provide a full path to your
      favourite &pdf; viewer application.

      <link linkend="services">file a bug</link> so the problem can be
      fixed in future releases.

    <question><para>
     What is the test suite, and how do I run it?
    </para></question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Sometimes, building an application on significantly different
      hardware or against different versions of helper libraries can lead
      to unforseen bugs that do not appear on the developer's machine(s).
      To help guard against such problems, &regina; ships with a test
      suite.  The test suite uses &regina; to perform a variety of
      different computations that isolate different portions of
      &regina;'s mathematical code, and it verifies that &regina; gets
      the answers correct.
     </para>
     <para>
      The test suite comes with the &regina; source distribution, and it
      assumes that you are building &regina; yourself.  Note that the
      test suite requires <application>CppUnit</application> to be
      installed, as described on the &sysreq; on the &regina; website.
     </para>
     <para>
      To build and run the test suite, simply move into the main source
      directory and type <userinput>make check</userinput>.  After the
      test suite has been compiled, you should see the individual tests
      being run as illustrated below.

     Something else not described in this list has gone
     wrong.  Perhaps something crashed.  Maybe the program gave the wrong
     answer.  Or it could be just a little too slow.

      Please! - mail me at &regemail; and let me know.  Or even better,
      use the <link linkend="services">&sourceforge; services</link>
      such as the bug tracking system and mailing lists so that the
      problem you report is publicly archived.

      This program is permanently in development.  There is a very
      long &todo; list, and chances are your problem is on it.  And
      then again chances are it's not.  So please let me know so I
      am sure to know what needs to be fixed/improved.
