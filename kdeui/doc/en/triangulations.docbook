 <title>Triangulations</title>

 <para>
  Most 3-manifolds in &regina; are represented by
  <firstterm>triangulations</firstterm>.  A triangulation is a
  particular representation of particular 3-manifold, consisting of a
  set of tetrahedra and instructions on how (some of) the faces of these
  tetrahedra are to be glued together in pairs.

     <guimenuitem>New Triangulation</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    menu item (or the corresponding toolbar button),

    this point, several choices are offered as described below.
   </para>

   <sect3 id="tri-new-empty">
    <title>Empty</title>

    <para>
     This will create a new triangulation with no tetrahedra at all.
     This option is best if you have a triangulation you wish to enter
     in by hand, in which case you can create a new empty triangulation
     and then manually <link linkend="tri-editgluings">add tetrahedra

     where both parameters are non-negative, coprime and
     <replaceable>p</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>q</replaceable>

    <para>
     A <firstterm>layered lens space</firstterm> is a lens space built
     by taking two layered solid tori with appropriate parameters

    <para>
     This will create an orientable &sfslong; over the 2-sphere with any
     number of exceptional fibres.  &regina; will choose the simplest
     construction that it knows based upon the given &sfslong; parameters.
     Examples of constructions that are used include
     <link linkend="tri-new-lens">layered lens spaces</link>,

     parameter; each additional twist can be incorporated into the existing
     parameters by replacing some pair
     (&ai;,&bi;) with the pair (&ai;,&ai;+&bi;).
     Including pairs of the form (1,<replaceable>k</replaceable>) and even
     (1,0) is acceptable (in which case a lens space may result).

    <para>
     A <firstterm>layered solid torus</firstterm> is a solid torus built
     by taking a one-tetrahedron solid torus and repeatedly adding
     layers.  A new layer is added by taking a new tetrahedron and
     gluing two of its faces as a square onto the existing torus
     boundary; the remaining two faces of the new tetrahedron then form
     the new torus boundary.  Note that each new layer can be added in
     three different ways (corresponding to the three different two-face
     squares that can be chosen on the torus boundary).  The
     parameters of the layered solid torus represent the ways in which
     the different layers have been added.

    <para>
     In the <guilabel>Skeletal Components</guilabel> tab itself appears the
     total number of vertices, edges and so on.  Beside each count

     providing explicit structural details for each individual object
     as described below.

    <sect4 id="tri-vertexedgeface">
     <title>Vertices, Edges and Faces</title>
     <para>
      The vertex table, the edge table and the face table all have similar
      structures.
     </para>
     <para>
      In the first column, the vertices, edges or faces are individually
      numbered from 0 upwards.
     </para>
     <para>
      The second column (labelled <guilabel>Type</guilabel>) describes
      properties of each vertex, edge or face using zero or more
      of the <link linkend="tri-vertextype">property labels
      described below</link>.  Note that an object might
      have no interesting properties at all.
     </para>
     <para>
      The third column in the table lists the degree of the vertex,
      edge or face.
     </para>
     <para>
      The final column lists precisely which vertices
      of which tetrahedra form the vertex, edge or face (recall that the
      four vertices of an individual tetrahedron are numbered 0, 1, 2 and
      3).  An example for an edge is
      <literal>1(20), 4(12), 2(21)</literal> which shows that
      the edge is the result of identifying edge 20 of tetrahedron 1,
      edge 12 of tetrahedron 4 and edge 21 of tetrahedron 2 (where edge
      21 is the edge joining vertex 2 with vertex 1 of that tetrahedron
      and so on).
      The order of vertices is important; this example also shows that
      vertex 2 of tetrahedron 1, vertex 1 of tetrahedron 4 and vertex 2
      of tetrahedron 2 all represent the same end of the edge.
     </para>
     <para>
      In the specific case of edges, the order in which the tetrahedra are
      presented in this column is also important.  Tetrahedra are presented
      in the order in which they are seen when following around the edge link.

      boundary components from 0 upwards.

      boundary component formed by an ideal vertex will have zero faces.
     </para>
     <para>
      The fourth column lists the individual tetrahedra forming the
      component or the individual faces or vertices forming the
      boundary component.  In the case of a boundary component, faces and

     Each Turaev-Viro invariant corresponds to a particular set of initial

     invariants appear <xref linkend="bib-turaevviro"/>.  In particular,
     Section 7 of this paper describes the initial data as determined

     To calculate a Turaev-Viro invariant, a pair of integers

     should be entered into the text box provided.  The integer
     <replaceable>r</replaceable> is used directly in the initial data
     as described above.  The integer <replaceable>root</replaceable>

     Once calculated, the invariant will be displayed in the list box

     If it exists, the dehydration string for the triangulation is also

     Note that dehydration strings only exist for connected
     triangulations with no boundary faces and at most 25 tetrahedra.
     Furthermore, they implicitly describe a canonical ordering of the
     triangulation tetrahedra and vertices &mdash; dehydrating and then
     recreating a triangulation may not give you the same triangulation
     back, though it will certainly give you an <emphasis>isomorphic</emphasis>

  <sect2 id="tri-editgluings">
   <title>Editing Face Gluings</title>

   <para>
    When viewing a triangulation, the <guilabel>Gluings</guilabel> tab
    allows the user to add or remove tetrahedra and manually edit the
    gluings between tetrahedron faces.
   </para>
   <para>
    Tetrahedra are numbered beginning at 0; thus if a triangulation has
    three tetrahedra they will be numbered 0, 1 and 2.  Tetrahedra can
    be added and removed using the <guilabel>Add Tet</guilabel> and
    <guilabel>Remove Tet</guilabel> buttons above the gluing editor.
   </para>
   <para>
    The gluing editor itself contains a grid of tetrahedron faces.  Each
    row represents a tetrahedron in the triangulation and each column
    represents one of the four tetrahedron faces.  Tetrahedron vertices
    are numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3, and each tetrahedron face is identified
    by the three vertices that it contains.
   </para>
   <para>
    Each cell of this grid identifies to what the corresponding face is
    glued.  If a cell is empty,
    corresponding face is a boundary face and is glued to nothing at
    all.  Otherwise it will contain a string like
    <literal>5 (312)</literal>.  This means that the face for that cell is
    glued to face 312 of tetrahedron 5.  In particular, if the cell in
    question belongs to face 013 of tetrahedron 4, this means that
    vertices 0, 1 and 3 of tetrahedron 4 are glued to vertices 3, 1 and
    2 of tetrahedron 5 respectively.  Thus the cell contents describe
    the precise gluing permutation.
   </para>
   <para>
    To change how the face is glued, click in the cell.
    If you are in direct edit mode, you can simply type a new gluing
    over top of the old one in the format described above.  If you are
    in pop-up dialog mode, a button will appear; when this button is
    clicked a dialog will appear that allows a new gluing to be
    selected.  The mode can be changed between direct edit and
    pop-up dialog in the
    <link linkend="options-triangulation">triangulation options</link>.

    Tetrahedra can be optionally named to help
    keep track of their roles within a triangulation.  To change the
    name of a tetrahedron, click on the cell containing the tetrahedron
    number on the left hand side of the grid.  The new name can be
    typed directly into the cell.

    menu item performs one such task.  When this menu item is selected,
    all real boundary components of the triangulation are converted into
    ideal boundary components.
   </para>
   <para>
    Specifically, each boundary component that is formed from two or
    more boundary faces is converted into a single ideal vertex.  This
    is done by gluing a tetrahedron to each boundary face, and then
    gluing these tetrahedra together to mirror the ways in
    which the boundary faces are joined.  The new vertices opposite
    the boundary faces then become identified as a single ideal vertex.
   </para>
   <para>
    One side-effect of this operation is that any spherical boundary
    components become filled in with balls (since the new vertex
    will have a spherical link, i.e., it will become an ordinary
    internal vertex).  If the triangulation has no boundary faces (i.e.,
    no real boundary components) then this operation does nothing.

    0-efficiency conversion is currently only available for closed
    orientable triangulations.  Furthermore, if the triangulation
    represents a composite 3-manifold then it is impossible to construct
    a 0-efficient triangulation &ndash; in this case a full connected sum
    decomposition will be inserted beneath this triangulation in the
    packet tree.
   </para>

   <warning><para>
    This procedure involves an analysis of normal surfaces and can be
    very slow for large triangulations.  For a faster but perhaps less
    effective simplification of triangulations, see the
    <link linkend="tri-simplification">global simplification</link>
    routine described above.

   <title>Cutting Along and Crushing Normal Surfaces</title>

   <para>
    A triangulation can be modified by finding a normal surface within
    it, and either cutting along that surface or crushing it to a point.
    Each operation has its advantages and disadvantages:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
     Cutting along a surface will never change the topology of the
     3-manifold beyond the simple act of slicing along the surface.
     However, it has the potential to <emphasis>vastly</emphasis>
     increase the number of tetrahedra in the triangulation.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Crushing a surface to a point will never increase the number of
      tetrahedra (and generally will reduce it).  However, crushing can
      introduce additional unexpected changes to the topology of the
      3-manifold, and in some cases can introduce ideal vertices or
      invalid edges.  For details see
      <function><classname>NNormalSurface</classname>::crush()</function>
      in the &regenginedocs;.
     </para>
     <para>
      In general you should only crush a surface to
      a point when there are theoretical reasons to know that this is
      safe.  Examples of safe scenarios can be found in Jaco and
      Rubinstein's paper on 0-efficiency <xref linkend="bib-0-efficiency"/>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    A normal surface can be cut along or crushed as follows.
    Open a list of normal surfaces,
    select the surface to operate upon, and invoke either the
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Normal Surfaces</guimenu>
     <guimenuitem>Cut Along Surface</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    or the
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Normal Surfaces</guimenu>
     <guimenuitem>Crush Surface</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    menu item (note that these menu items only appear when viewing a
    normal surface list).
    A new triangulation will be created in which the surface has been
    cut along or crushed accordingly.
    The original triangulation will not be changed.

  <title>Decomposition</title>

  <para>
   Recall the analysis of <link linkend="tri-composition">combinatorial
   composition</link> described earlier.  This analysis simply involves
   searching for well-structured features that &regina; can recognise
   within a triangulation.  For triangulations without any particularly
   nice structure, the combinatorial composition may give no information
   at all (many non-minimal triangulations are like this).
  </para>

  <para>
   Here we describe some more complete decomposition tools that are
   available.  These decomposition tools are guaranteed to work on any
   triangulation, regardless of whether it is minimal and/or
   particularly well-structured.  The trade-off is that these
   decomposition tools often make heavy use of normal surfaces and can
   be quite slow for larger triangulations.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="tri-decomposition-component">
   <title>Component Decomposition</title>

   <para>
    &regina; can work with disconnected triangulations as well as
    connected triangulations.  It may be desirable at times to break a
    large disconnected triangulation into smaller separate triangulations
    for its individual components.  For this operation the
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Triangulation</guimenu>
     <guimenuitem>Extract Components</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    menu item can be used.
   </para>
   <para>
    Each (connected) component triangulation will be inserted as a new
    triangulation beneath the original in the packet tree.  The
    original triangulation will remain unchanged.
   </para>
   <para>
    Unlike most of the decomposition algorithms described in this
    section, component decomposition is very fast and should perform
    without problems for very large triangulations.

  <sect2 id="tri-decomposition-connsum">
   <title>Connected Sum Decomposition</title>

   <para>
    For closed orientable connected 3-manifold triangulations,
    &regina; can in fact completely decompose the triangulation into a
    connected sum of prime 3-manifolds.
    The algorithm used is essentially the 0-efficiency algorithm of
    Jaco and Rubinstein <xref linkend="bib-0-efficiency"/>, which in turn
    relies upon Rubinstein's 3-sphere recognition algorithm
    <xref linkend="bib-rubin-3sphere1"/> <xref linkend="bib-rubin-3sphere2"/>.
   </para>

   <para>
    This decomposition can be performed using the
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Triangulation</guimenu>
     <guimenuitem>Connected Sum Decomposition</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    menu item.  As before, a smaller prime triangulation for each
    summand will be inserted beneath the original triangulation in
    the packet tree, with the original triangulation remaining unchanged.
    It is guaranteed that each of the smaller prime triangulations will
    be 0-efficient (i.e., will have no non-vertex-linking normal spheres).
