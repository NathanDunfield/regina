Patches to standard build components
------------------------------------

Some components of the standard build infrastructure have been patched
for Regina.  These changes are recorded in the file admin.patch, and the
reasons for these changes are outlined below.

- Adding -flat_namespace to libtool.m4.ext:

  On MacOSX, when $MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is defined and set
  sufficiently high, libtool defaults to using two-level namespaces.
  This causes problems with the python module; in particular,
  regina-python crashes with a bus error because the module cannot
  resolve the core python symbols.  Adding the -flat_namespace flag
  resolves this problem (presumably because it can now resolve the
  symbols from the surrounding python executable).

  Patched 23 September 2007.

- Mangling #serial markers in kde.m4.ext and libtool.m4.ext:

  Automake 1.10 issues warnings because several #serial markers from several
  different places are bundled together in the same file (acinclude.m4).
  This patch prevents automake from recognising the #serial markers, which
  are not actually needed during regina's build process.

  Patched 1 September 2008.
