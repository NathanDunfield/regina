.SH NAME
regfiledump \- Dump the contents of a Regina data file
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregfiledump\fR [ \fB-f\fR | \fB-l\fR | \fB-n\fR ] [ \fB-c\fR ] \fB\fIfile\fB\fR [ \fB\fIpacket-label\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility dumps the contents of the given \fBRegina\fR data file to
standard output in a human-readable format.
.PP
If a list of packet labels is given on the command-line, only those
packets listed will be output.  Otherwise all packets in the given
file will be output.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-f (default)\fR
Output full packet details.  Output for each packet will cover
several lines, beginning with basic packet details (such as label
and type) followed by the packet's long description.
.TP
\fB-l\fR
Output a list of packet labels and types only, one packet per line.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Don't output any packets at all; this option forces a packet
count (see option \fB-c\fR).
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Finish output with a count of all packets in the given file.
.SH "INTERNATIONALISATION"
.PP
If any packets contain international characters,
\fBRegina\fR will attempt to convert these to your local character
encoding as it writes them to the output.
.PP
You can tell \fBRegina\fR what character encoding to use by setting
standard locale-related environment variables, such as
\fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR or
\fBLC_ALL\fR\&.
.PP
For example, if \fBLANG\fR is set to
en_AU then output will be written in the
Western European character set ISO-8859-1,
and if \fBLANG\fR is set to
en_AU.UTF-8 then output will be written in the
universal character set UTF-8\&.
.PP
Typically these environment variables will have been set for you when
you installed your GNU/Linux system, and \fBRegina\fR should just use the
right character set out of the box.  See your GNU/Linux system reference
for further information on support for different locales.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
regina-kde\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBRegina\fR was written by Ben Burton <bab@debian.org> with help from others;
see the documentation for full details.
