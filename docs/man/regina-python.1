.SH NAME
regina-python \- Regina command-line Python interface
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregina-python\fR [ \fB-q, --quiet\fR | \fB-v, --verbose\fR ] [ \fB-n, --nolibs\fR ]


\fBregina-python\fR [ \fB-q, --quiet\fR | \fB-v, --verbose\fR ] [ \fB-n, --nolibs\fR ] [ \fB-i, --interactive\fR ] \fB\fIscript\fB\fR [ \fB\fIscript-args\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBRegina\fR is a topological calculator with a bent towards normal surface
theory. It allows 3-manifolds to be created and manipulated and their
properties of interest to be determined.
.PP
This command starts an interactive \fBPython\fR session for
\fBRegina\fR\&.  This will be a command-line \fBPython\fR session, with direct
text input/output and no graphical user interface.
All of the objects, clases and methods from the \fBRegina\fR calculation
engine will be made available to the user in the module
\fIregina\fR, which will be imported on startup.
.PP
Before the session begins, a number of libraries may be loaded.
Libraries are simply files containing \fBPython\fR code to be run at the
beginning of each \fBPython\fR session.  The list of libraries to load
will be read from the text file \fI~/.regina-libs\fR, which should contain one
library filename per line.  Blank lines and lines beginning with a
hash (#) will be ignored.  Note that the list of currently active
libraries can also be configured through the \fBKDE\fR user interface
on the \fBPython\fR options page.
.PP
Instead of starting an interactive \fBPython\fR session, a python script
can be passed (with arguments if desired).  In this case the script
will be run, again with the \fIregina\fR module
imported and libraries loaded beforehand.  Once the script has
finished the user will be returned to the command-line, i.e., there
will be no subsequent \fBPython\fR interaction (this behaviour can be
changed by passing \fB--interactive\fR).
.PP
Note that \fBregina-python\fR may be run directly out
of its source tree without being properly installed.  Default locations
for various \fBRegina\fR components will be transparently modified to
look inside the source tree.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-q\fR
.TP
\fB--quiet\fR
Start in quiet mode.  No output will be produced except
for serious errors.  In particular, warnings will be suppressed.

This is equivalent to setting the environment variable
\fIREGINA_VERBOSITY\fR=0\&.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
.TP
\fB--verbose\fR
Start in verbose mode.  Additional diagnostic
information will be output.

This is equivalent to setting the environment variable
\fIREGINA_VERBOSITY\fR=2\&.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
.TP
\fB--nolibs\fR
Do not load any user libraries.  This refers to the libraries
specified in \fI~/.regina-libs\fR and/or configured through the \fBKDE\fR user
interface, as described in the overview above.
.TP
\fB-i\fR
.TP
\fB--interactive\fR
Run the script in interactive mode.  The given script will be
executed, and then the user will be left in the \fBPython\fR
interpreter to run their own additonal commands.

This option is only available when a script is passed.
If no script is passed, \fBregina-python\fR will
always start in interactive mode.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
The following environment variables influence the behaviour of
this program.  Each of these variables can also be set in the local
configuration file \fI~/.regina-python\fR using a line
of the form
\fIoption\fR=\fIvalue\fR\&.
Environment variables will take precedence over values read from
this configuration file.
.TP
\fB\fIREGINA_VERBOSITY\fB\fR
Specifies how much output should be generated.
Recognised values are:
.RS
.TP
\fB0\fR
Display errors only; this is equivalent to passing the option
\fB--quiet\fR\&.
.TP
\fB1\fR
Display errors and warnings; this is the default.
.TP
\fB2\fR
Display errors, warnings and diagnostic output; this is
equivalent to passing the option \fB--verbose\fR\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\fIREGINA_PYTHON\fB\fR
The command used to start the \fBPython\fR interpreter.  If the command
\fBpython\fR can be found on the path then this option
defaults to the full path of that command
(such as \fB/usr/bin/python\fR).

Note that this must be the same version of \fBPython\fR that \fBRegina\fR
was compiled against.  Otherwise the
\fIregina\fR module will be unable to be loaded.
.TP
\fB\fIREGINA_HOME\fB\fR
The directory in which \fBRegina\fR data files are installed.  This
should be the directory containing the \fIscripts/\fR
subdirectory, the \fIicons/\fR subdirectory and so on.

If \fBRegina\fR is being run directly out of the source tree, this
defaults to the top-level source directory.  If \fBRegina\fR is being
run from a proper installation, this defaults to the corresponding
installation directory.

In normal situations you should never need to set this option yourself.
.sp
.RS
.B "Warning:"
When running from a proper installation,
the default \fIREGINA_HOME\fR is actually
hard-wired into the startup script (it is derived at
compile-time from the options passed to
\fB\&./configure\fR).
This means that if \fBRegina\fR is installed into one directory using
\fBmake install\fR and then moved to another directory
by hand, the default \fIREGINA_HOME\fR will be
incorrect.
.RE
.TP
\fB\fIREGINA_PYLIBDIR\fB\fR
The directory containing the \fBPython\fR module
\fIregina.so\fR\&.

If \fBRegina\fR is being run directly out of the source tree, this
defaults to a directory within this source tree.  If \fBRegina\fR is being
run from a proper installation, this defaults to the corresponding
installation directory.

In normal situations you should never need to set this option yourself.
.sp
.RS
.B "Warning:"
Like \fIREGINA_HOME\fR,
when running from a proper installation
the default \fIREGINA_PYLIBDIR\fR is
hard-wired into the startup script.
This means that if \fBRegina\fR is installed into one directory using
\fBmake install\fR and then moved to another directory
by hand, the default \fIREGINA_PYLIBDIR\fR will be
incorrect.
.RE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
regina-kde\&.
.PP
The calculation engine documentation should also be
installed, describing in detail all of the \fBRegina\fR
objects, classes and methods that are available.  This is generally
installed in \fI/usr/share/regina/engine-docs/\fR
or \fI/usr/local/share/regina/engine-docs/\fR, though your
distribution may differ.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBRegina\fR was written by Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>
with help from others; see the documentation for full details.
