/**
 * A <i>dim</i>-dimensional triangulation, built by gluing together
 * <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplices along their (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional
 * facets.  Typically (but not necessarily) such triangulations are used
 * to represent <i>dim</i>-manifolds.
 *
 * Such triangulations are not the same as pure simplicial complexes, for two
 * reasons:
 *
 * - The only identifications that the user can explicitly specify are
 *   gluings between <i>dim</i>-dimensional simplices along their
 *   (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional facets.  All other identifications between
 *   <i>k</i>-faces (for any \a k) are simply consequences of these
 *   (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional gluings.  In contrast, a simplicial complex
 *   allows explicit gluings between faces of any dimension.
 *
 * - There is no requirement for a <i>k</i>-face to have (<i>k</i>+1) distinct
 *   vertices (so, for example, edges may be loops).  Many distinct
 *   <i>k</i>-faces of a top-dimensional simplex may be identified together
 *   as a consequence of the (<i>dim</i>-1)-dimensional gluings, and indeed
 *   we are even allowed to glue together two distinct factets of the same
 *   <i>dim</i>-simplex.  In contrast, a simplicial complex does not allow
 *   any of these situations.
 *
 * Amongst other things, this definition is general enough to capture
 * any reasonable definition of a <i>dim</i>-manifold triangulation.
 * However, there is no requirement that a triangulation must actually
 * represent a manifold (and indeed, testing this condition is undecidable
 * for sufficiently large \a dim).
 *
 * You can construct a triangulation from scratch using routines such as
 * newSimplex() and Simplex<dim>::join().  There are also routines for
 * importing and exporting triangulations in bulk, such as isoSig() and
 * fromIsoSig() (which uses <em>isomorphism signatures</em>), or
 * insertConstruction() and dumpConstruction() (which exports C++ code).
 *
 * In additional to top-dimensional simplices, this class also tracks
 * connected components of the triangulation, as represented by the
 * class Component<dim>.  Such objects are temporary: whenever the
 * triangulation changes, they will be deleted and rebuilt, and any
 * pointers to them will become invalid.  Likewise, if the triangulation
 * is deleted then all component objects will be deleted alongside it.
 *
 * For Regina's \ref stddim "standard dimensions", this template is specialised
 * and offers \e much more functionality.  In order to use these specialised
 * classes, you will need to include the corresponding headers (e.g.,
 * dim2/dim2triangulation.h for \a dim = 2, or triangulation/ntriangulation.h
 * for \a dim = 3).  For convenience, there are typedefs available for
 * these specialised classes (such as Dim2Triangulation and NTriangulation
 * respectively).
 *
 * \ifacespython Python does not support templates.  For standard dimensions
 * this class can be used by appending the dimension as a suffix
 * (e.g., Triangulation2 and Triangulation3 for dimensions 2 and 3).
 * The typedefs mentioned above (e.g., Dim2Triangulation and NTriangulation)
 * are also available.  Higher-dimensional classes are not available
 * in Python for the time being.
 *
 * \tparam dim the dimension of the underlying triangulation.
 * This must be at least 2.

         * - If Triangulation<dim> does not derive from NPacket, then
