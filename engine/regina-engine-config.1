.SH SYNOPSIS
.B regina-engine-config
[\fB\-\-prefix\fP[=\fIDIR\fP]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIregina-engine-config\fP is used to determine which compiler and
linker flags should be used with programs that wish to incorporate the
mathematical engine of Regina.  This engine is provided by the library
\fIlibregina-engine.so\fP.
.PP
Regina is a topological calculator with a bent towards normal surface
theory.  It allows 3-manifolds to be created and manipulated and their
properties of interest to be determined.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIregina-engine-config\fP accepts the following options.
.TP
\fB\-\-prefix\fP=\fIDIR\fP
If specified, use DIR instead of the installation prefix that Regina
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if \-\-exec\-prefix is not specified.  This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
If no DIR is specified then the current installation prefix will be
written to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-\-exec\-prefix\fP=\fIDIR\fP
If specified, use DIR instead of the installation exec prefix that
Regina was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
If no DIR is specified then the current installation exec prefix will be
written to standard output.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of Regina.
.TP
.B \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program against
the Regina calculation engine.
.TP
.B \-\-cflags
