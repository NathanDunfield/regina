/**
 * Macros for defining which symbols should be exported in the
 * calculation engine shared library.
 *
 * All non-templated, non-static functions and classes that are part of
 * Regina's public interface \b must be declared with REGINA_API.
 * Otherwise things may (and in some environments will) break when external
 * applications try to use Regina with optimisations such as gcc's
 * -fvisibility=hidden.
 *
 * Classes and functions that are local to the current compilation unit
 * and should not be publicly exported may be declared with REGINA_LOCAL,
 * though this is optional.
 *
 * When building the Regina calculation engine shared library,
 * REGINA_DLL_EXPORTS must be defined (this ensures that API symbols are
 * marked for export).  When importing (using) this library,
 * REGINA_DLL_EXPORTS must not be defined (this ensures that API symbols
 * are marked for import instead).
 *
 * The macros below are modified from the instructions at
 * http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility (retrieved on 22 May 2011).
