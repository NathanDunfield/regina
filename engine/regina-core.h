/**
 * A synonym for \c inline, used in some special cases to avoid
 * noisy warnings under Windows.
 *
 * Typically this macro is used with inline functions of some class or struct
 * that are called by \e other inline function(s).
 *
 * Such a function should:
 *
 * - be declared as \c REGINA_INLINE_REQUIRED at the point where the function
 *   is first declared inside the class definition;
 *
 * - be declared again as \c inline when the function is later defined
 *   (as Regina does with all its inline functions).
 *
 * The reason for using REGINA_INLINE_REQUIRED in such situations is to
 * avoid noisy warnings about \c dllimport attributes under Windows.
 * The reason for using this particular macro instead of just the
 * keyword \c inline is to remind the Regina developers not to remove it.
 *
 * This is not the first, and will surely not be the last, piece of code
 * bloat that Windows forces upon us.  Sigh.
