 *  Normal Hypersurface Coordinate System Flavour Registry
 *  ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *
 *    THIS FILE SHOULD BE EDITED EACH TIME A NEW FLAVOUR OF COORDINATE
 *        SYSTEM IS CREATED!
 *
 *    Note that this registry should only contain flavours of coordinate
 *        system that can actually be used to create and store normal
 *        hypersurfaces.
 *
 *    For each such flavour there should be a line of the form:
 *
 *        REGISTER_HSFLAVOUR(id_name, class, name)
 *
 *    where:
 *        id_name = the constant int member of NNormalHypersurfaceList that
 *            represents this flavour.
 *        class = the C++ subclass of NNormalHypersurfaceVector that uses this
 *            coordinate system.
 *        name = the string (English) name of the new flavour.
 *
 *    The appropriate include files should also be placed in the
 *        appropriate include sections below.
 *
 *    To use the flavour registry, simply #include this file.  If you
 *        have not defined __HSFLAVOUR_REGISTRY_BODY, only the include
 *        sections will be brought in.  If you have defined
 *        __HSFLAVOUR_REGISTRY_BODY, the include sections will be skipped
 *        and the REGISTER_HSFLAVOUR lines will be brought in instead.
 *        By suitably defining the macro REGISTER_HSFLAVOUR before including
 *        this file, you can have these lines do whatever you wish.
 *
 *    If you do #include this file, be sure to #undef both
 *        REGISTER_HSFLAVOUR and __HSFLAVOUR_REGISTRY_BODY when you are
 *        finished, so that if --enable-final is being used then these
 *        macros are left undefined for the following files.

 *
 *  Each time a new flavour is created, this flavour registry should be

 *  <i>hsflavourregistry.h</i>, which also contains instructions regarding
 *  how to actually use the flavour registry.
