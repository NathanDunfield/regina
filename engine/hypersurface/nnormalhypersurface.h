/**
 * Stores the vector of a single normal hypersurface in a 4-manifold
 * triangulation.  The different subclasses of NNormalHypersurfaceVector use
 * different underlying coordinate systems for the normal solution space.
 * However, the various coordinate retrieval routines will return values
 * that are independent of the underlying coordinate system.  Thus the
 * coordinates of the normal hypersurface in any coordinate system can be
 * determined without knowledge of the specific underlying coordinate
 * system being used.
 *
 * Note that if a mirrored vector class is being used (see
 * NNormalHypersurfaceVectorMirrored), the vector <b>may not change</b> once
 * the first coordinate lookup routine (such as getTetrahedronCoord() and
 * the like) has been called.  See
 * NNormalHypersurfaceVectorMirrored for further explanation.
 *
 * Note that non-compact hypersurfaces (surfaces with infinitely many pieces)
 * are allowed; in these cases, the corresponding coordinate lookup routines
 * should return NLargeInteger::infinity where appropriate.
 *
 * All subclasses of NNormalHypersurfaceVector <b>must</b> have the following
 * properties:
 *
 * - Normal hypersurfaces can be enumerated by intersecting the non-negative
 *   orthant of the underlying vector space with some linear subspace;
 *
 * - Multiplying a normal hypersurface by \a k corresponds to multiplying
 *   the underlying vector by \a k for any non-negative integer \a k.
 *
 * <b>When deriving classes from NNormalHypersurfaceVector:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A unique constant (static const int) must be added to the class
 *   NNormalHypersurfaceList to represent the new flavour of coordinate
 *   system.</li>
 *   <li>The file hsflavourregistry.h must be updated to reflect the new
 *   flavour of coordinate system.</li>
 *   <li>Constructors <tt>class(unsigned length)</tt> and
 *   <tt>class(const NVector<NLargeInteger>& cloneMe)</tt> must be
 *   declared and implemented; these will usually just call the
 *   corresponding superclass constructors.</li>
 *   <li>The virtual function <tt>NNormalHypersurfaceVector* clone() const</tt>
 *   must be declared but not implemented.  The registry utilities will take
 *   care of its implementation.</li>
 *   <li>All abstract functions must be implemented.
 *   Note that coordinate functions such as getTetrahedronCoord() must return
 *   the \e total number of pieces of the requested type; if your new
 *   coordinate system adorns pieces with extra information (such as
 *   orientation) then your implementation must compute the appropriate
 *   sum.</li>
 *   <li>Static public functions <tt>void
 *   makeZeroVector(const Dim4Triangulation*)</tt>,
