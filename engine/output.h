/**
 * A common base class for objects that write human-readable text output.
 * This class ensures that text output routines have consistent
 * names and behaviours across Regina's entire API.
 *
 * Two types of output are supported: \e short output, which fits on a
 * single line; and \e detailed output, which may be arbitrarily long.
 *
 * Any class that provides text output should ultimately inherit from
 * this base class.  Your derived class must provide two functions,
 * each of which takes a single std::ostream& argument:
 *
 * - \a writeTextShort(out), which writes the short output to the given
 * output stream;
 *
 * - \a writeTextLong(out), which writes the detailed output to the given
 * output stream.
 *
 * The documentation for str() and detail() gives guidelines as to how
 * this output should be formatted.
 *
 * In return, this class will provide the functions str() and detail(),
 * which return these short and detailed outputs respectively in
 * std::string format.  It will also provide a global operator << that
 * allows you to write objects of type \a T to an arbitrary output stream.
 *
 * If your class is simple and has no need for detailed output then it may
 * derive from ShortOutput instead, which provides a default
 * implementation for \a writeTextLong().
 *
 * \tparam T the class that provides the implementations of
 * \a writeTextShort() and \a writeTextLong().  Typically this will be
 * your own class (i.e., your class \a C derives from Output<C>).
 * However, this may be deeper in the class hierarchy.
 *
 * \note Every object of this class that is ever instantiated \e must be
 * derived from the class \a T.  In other words, end users can construct
 * objects of type \a T (which derives from Output<T>), but they cannot
 * construct objects of the parent class Output<T> itself.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present, but the output routines str() and detail() will
 * be provided directly through the various subclasses.
