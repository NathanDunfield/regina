/**
 * Represents a component of the boundary of a triangulation.
 * Note that an ideal vertex constitutes a boundary component of its
 * own.
 *
 * We can run into some interesting cases with invalid triangulations.
 * Suppose some vertex link is a multiply punctured surface (which makes
 * the vertex and hence the entire triangulation invalid).  This means
 * that different parts of the 3-manifold boundary are effectively
 * "pinched" together.  If this happens, the different parts of the
 * boundary that are pinched might or might not be listed as part of the
 * same boundary component; if not then the offending vertex will be
 * included in all of these boundary components.  Nevertheless, only one
 * of these can be considered the "official" boundary component of the
 * vertex as returned by NVertex::getBoundaryComponent().  This is all a
 * bit of a mess, but then again the entire triangulation is invalid and
 * so you almost certainly have bigger problems to deal with.
 *
 * Boundary components are highly temporary; once a triangulation
 * changes, all its boundary component objects will be deleted and new
 * ones will be created.
