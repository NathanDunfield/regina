/**
 * Represents a combinatorial isomorphism from one triangulation into
 * another.
 *
 * A combinatorial isomorphism from triangulation T to triangulation U
 * is a one-to-one map f from the individual tetrahedron faces of T to
 * the individual tetrahedron faces of U for which the following
 * conditions hold:
 *
 *   - if faces x and y belong to the same tetrahedron of T then
 *     faces f(x) and f(y) belong to the same tetrahedron of U;
 *   - if faces x and y are identified in T then faces f(x) and f(y)
 *     are identified in U.
 *
 * Isomorphisms can be <i>boundary complete</i> or
 * <i>boundary incomplete</i>.  A boundary complete isomorphism
 * satisfies the additional condition:
 *
 *   - if face x is a boundary face of T then face f(x) is a boundary
 *     face of U.
 *
 * A boundary complete isomorphism thus indicates that a copy of
 * triangulation T is present as an entire component (or components) of U,
 * whereas a boundary incomplete isomorphism represents an embedding of a
 * copy of triangulation T as a subcomplex of some possibly larger component
 * (or components) of U.
 *
 * Note that in all cases triangulation U may contain more tetrahedra
 * than triangulation T.
 *
 * This class cannot be directly instantiated; the individual subclasses
 * correspond to different methods of storing the face permutations
 * associated with each tetrahedron.
