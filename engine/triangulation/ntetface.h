 * With this in mind, it is also possible to represent the overall
 * boundary, a past-the-end value and a before-the-start value.
 *
 * When iterating through the tetrahedron faces, the faces will be
 * ordered first by tetrahedron index and then by face number.  The
 * overall boundary appears after all other tetrahedron faces.
 *
 * If there are \a n tetrahedra, the tetrahedra will be numbered from 0
 * to <i>n</i>-1 inclusive.  The boundary will be represented as
 * tetrahedron \a n, face 0.  The past-the-end value will be represented
 * as tetrahedron \a n, face 1, and the before-the-start value will be
