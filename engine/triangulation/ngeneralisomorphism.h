/**
 * A dimension-agnostic base class that represents a combinatorial
 * isomorphism from one \a dim-manifold triangulation into another.
 * Each dimension that Regina works with (2, 3 and 4) offers its own
 * subclass with richer functionality; users typically do not need to
 * work with this template base class directly.
 *
 * In essence, a combinatorial isomorphism from triangulation T to
 * triangulation U is a one-to-one map from the simplices of T to the
 * simplices of U that allows relabelling of both the simplices and
 * their facets (or equivalently, their vertices), and that preserves
 * gluings across adjacent simplices.
 *
 * More precisely:  An isomorphism consists of (i) a one-to-one map f
 * from the simplices of T to the simplices of U, and (ii) for each
 * simplex S of T, a permutation f_S of the facets (0,...,\a dim) of S,
 * for which the following condition holds:
 *
 *   - If facet k of simplex S and facet k' of simplex S'
 *     are identified in T, then facet f_S(k) of f(S) and facet f_S'(k')
 *     of f(S') are identified in U.  Moreover, their gluing is consistent
 *     with the facet/vertex permutations; that is, there is a commutative
 *     square involving the gluing maps in T and U and the permutations
 *     f_S and f_S'.
 *
 * Isomorphisms can be <i>boundary complete</i> or
 * <i>boundary incomplete</i>.  A boundary complete isomorphism
 * satisfies the additional condition:
 *
 *   - If facet x is a boundary facet of T then facet f(x) is a boundary
 *     facet of U.
 *
 * A boundary complete isomorphism thus indicates that a copy of
 * triangulation T is present as an entire component (or components) of U,
 * whereas a boundary incomplete isomorphism represents an embedding of a
 * copy of triangulation T as a subcomplex of some possibly larger component
 * (or components) of U.
 *
 * Note that in all cases triangulation U may contain more simplices
 * than triangulation T.
 *
 * \pre The dimension argument \a dim is either 2, 3 or 4.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present, though the dimension-specific subclasses
 * (such as NIsomorphism and Dim4Isomorphism) are available for Python users.
