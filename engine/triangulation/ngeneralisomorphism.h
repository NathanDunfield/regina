/**
 * A dimension-agnostic base class that represents a combinatorial
 * isomorphism from one \a dim-manifold triangulation into another.
 *
 * TODO: Fix the class notes.
 *
 * A combinatorial isomorphism from triangulation T to triangulation U
 * is a one-to-one map f from the individual simplex facets of T to
 * the individual simplex facets of U for which the following
 * conditions hold:
 *
 *   - if facets x and y belong to the same simplex of T then
 *     facets f(x) and f(y) belong to the same simplex of U;
 *   - if facets x and y are identified in T then facets f(x) and f(y)
 *     are identified in U.
 *
 * Isomorphisms can be <i>boundary complete</i> or
 * <i>boundary incomplete</i>.  A boundary complete isomorphism
 * satisfies the additional condition:
 *
 *   - if facet x is a boundary facet of T then facet f(x) is a boundary
 *     facet of U.
 *
 * A boundary complete isomorphism thus indicates that a copy of
 * triangulation T is present as an entire component (or components) of U,
 * whereas a boundary incomplete isomorphism represents an embedding of a
 * copy of triangulation T as a subcomplex of some possibly larger component
 * (or components) of U.
 *
 * Note that in all cases triangulation U may contain more simplices
 * than triangulation T.
 *
 * \pre The dimension argument \a dim is either 2, 3 or 4.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present, though the dimension-specific subclasses
 * (such as NIsomorphism and Dim4Isomorphism) are available for Python users.
