/**
 *  This procedure takes as input the NBilinearForm intP which is required to be a torsion linking form on an abelian
 * group.  Specifically, it's assumed the map A x A --> Q/Z is symmetric, and the range is a trivially presented Z/nZ
 *
 * The procedure outputs the complete Kawauchi-Kojima invariants of the form, which are:
 *
 * 1) The prime power decomposition of A, as ppVec.
 *
 * 2) The classification of the 2-torsion linking pairing.  This invariant takes the form of a vector with n elements, where
 *    2^n is the order of the largest subgroup of A whose order is a power of two.  The entries of the vector represent which
 *    the angle of a certain vector V in the complex plane -- this vector can either be at the origin (8), or it is a non-zero
 *    vector along the line of angle 2(pi)i/8*k, k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  Kawauchi and Kojima use the symbol infinity to represent
 *    zero-sums, but we use 8. The vector V is the sum of e^{ 2^{i+1} pi i form(x,x) } where x ranges over ?? read KK paper
 *    again...  So this invariant is orientation-sensitive.  In particular if you reverse the orientation, the elements of the
 *    vector negate mod 8 (except for 8, which remains fixed).  So a vector (1 3 8 7 8) is turned to (7 5 8 1 8) on reversal
 *    of orientation. TODO: supply more details
 *
 * 3) The classification of the odd p-torsion linking pairing.  Given a prime power p^k, you consider the induced linking
 *    form on the quotient of elements of order p^k modulo p^{k-1}.  The determinant you can consider as an element of the
 *    field Z_p, and then you take the legendre symbol (whether or not the determinant is a square mod p).  This is the
 *    invariant, as a list for all p^k dividing the order of A, with p odd.  This invariant is also orientation-sensitive, 
 *    since when you change the orientation you negate the relevant matrices, so the legendre symbol changes if and 
 *    only if the rank n of the p^k-torsion mod p^(k-1) is odd and p | n^2 + 1. 
 *
 * The routine also outputs linkingFormPD, which is the restriction of the torsion linking form to the subgroups of A
 * divisible by all the prime factors of the order of A.
