 *  This documentation describes the functions, classes and related
 *  entities in the C++ calculation engine, as well as the mirroring of
 *  these in Python.
 *

 *  <h3>Orb Kernel</h3>
 *
 *  Since version 4.3.1 (May 2006), Regina includes snippets of code from
 *  Orb for use in importing and exporting files in Orb / Casson format.
 *  Orb is based on SnapPea (see above) with additional code written by
 *  Damian Heard, who has also given permission for his code to be
 *  distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

/*! \page i18n Encodings for international strings
 *
 *  As of version 4.5, Regina (finally) pays attention to character encodings.
 *
 *  The calculation engine uses UTF-8 for all strings (except possibly
 *  for filenames; see below).  This means that programmers who pass
 *  strings \e into routines must ensure that they use UTF-8, and
 *  programmers who receive strings \e from routines may assume that
 *  they are returned in UTF-8.  Note that plain ASCII is a subset of
 *  UTF-8, so plain ASCII text is always fine to use.
 *
 *  Regina's XML data files are also stored using UTF-8.  Older
 *  versions of Regina used LATIN1 (the default for the Qt libraries)
 *  and did not specify an encoding in the XML header; however, Regina's
 *  file I/O routines are aware of this, and will convert older data into
 *  UTF-8 as it is loaded into memory (the files themselves are
 *  of course not modified).  The routine versionUsesUTF8() may be
 *  useful for programmers who need to work with older data files at a
 *  low level.
 *
 *  File \e names are a special case, since here Regina must interact with
 *  the underlying operating system.  All filenames that are passed into
 *  routines must be presented in whatever encoding the operating system
 *  expects; Regina will simply pass them through to the standard C/C++ file
 *  I/O routines (such as fopen() or std::ifstream::open()) without modifying
 *  them in any way.
 *
 *  It should be noted that ancient data files that use the old binary
 *  format (Regina 2.x, before mid-2002) only support plain ASCII text.
 *  Support for the old binary format is likely to be removed entirely in the
 *  very near future.
 *
 *  \ifacespython Users and programmers who use the Python interface must
 *  take special care, since Python does not pass strings around in UTF-8
 *  by default.
 *
 *  Proper support for character encodings is quite new, and the main
 *  author rarely uses this (being a native English speaker).  If you
 *  see Regina treating international characters in unexpected ways,
 *  please mail the author(s) or file a bug report so the problem can be
 *  fixed!
