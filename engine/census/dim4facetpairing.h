 * Represents a specific pairwise matching of pentachoron facets.
 * Given a fixed number of pentachora, each pentachoron facet is either
 * paired with some other pentachoron facet (which is in turn paired with
 * it) or remains unmatched.  A pentachoron facet cannot be paired with
 * itself.
 *
 * Such a matching models part of the structure of a 4-manifold triangulation,
 * in which each pentachoron facet is either glued to some other pentachoron
 * facet (which is in turn glued to it) or is an unglued boundary facet.
 *
 * Note that if this pairing is used to construct an actual 4-manifold
 * triangulation, the individual gluing permutations will still need to
 * be specified; they are not a part of this structure.
