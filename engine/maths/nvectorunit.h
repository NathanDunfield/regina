 * A unit vector of type T.  A unit vector has every coordinate

 *
 * A unit vector takes almost no storage space and provides very fast
 * operations.  It should \e never be modified!  The modification
 * routines (such as <tt>=</tt>, <tt>+=</tt> and so on)
 * throw exceptions, since a modified
 * unit vector will probably no longer be a unit vector.  It is
 * recommended to declare any unit vector as \c const for a safeguard.
 *
 * Since a cloned vector might be modified, clone() will
 * return a new NVectorDense instead of a new NVectorUnit.
 *
 * The primary reason for having this class is for its dot product,
 * which is exceptionally fast since all it need do is look up the
 * corresponding coordinate of the other vector.
