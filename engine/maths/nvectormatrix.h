 * <tt>=</tt>, <tt>+=</tt> and so on) throw an exception when called.
 * It is recommended to declare any matrix vector as \c const for
 * a safeguard.
 *
 * If the matrix upon which this is vector is based should change, the
 * vector will change accordingly.  If it is destroyed, the vector will
 * become invalid and should not be used.
 *
 * Since a cloned vector might be modified, clone() will
 * return a new NVectorDense instead of a new NVectorMatrix.
