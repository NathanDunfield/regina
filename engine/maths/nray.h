 *
 * Like its parent class NVector, this ray class is slow (in
 * particular, many functions are virtual).  For a fast ray class better
 * suited to heavy computation, see NFastRay instead.
 * 
 * \warning Subclasses of NRay \b must override clone() to return a

 * vertex enumeration routines might be NRay objects instead of objects
 * of the appropriate derived class.
