         * The vertices of each tetrahedron in the vertex link are

         * sits within \c pent and is parallel to
         * <tt>pent->getTetrahedron(v)</tt>.
         * Then vertices 0,1,2,3 of the tetrahedron in the link will be

         * corresponding vertices of \c pent (those opposite \c v),
         * and will map 4 to \c v itself.
