/**
 * Represents a component of the boundary of a 4-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * Note that an ideal vertex constitutes a boundary component of its
 * own.  Likewise, an invalid vertex is placed in its own boundary
 * component if it does not already belong to some larger boundary
 * component.  See Dim4Vertex::isBoundary() for details.
 *
 * We can encounter some interesting cases with invalid triangulations.
 * Consider some vertex in a 4-manifold triangulation.  If the link of
 * this vertex is itself a 3-manifold with more than one boundary component
 * (which makes the vertex invalid), then different parts of the 4-manifold
 * boundary are effectively "pinched" together.  If this happens, the
 * different parts of the boundary that are pinched might or might not be
 * listed as part of the same boundary component; if not then the
 * offending vertex will be included in all of these boundary components.
 * Nevertheless, only one of these can be considered the "official" boundary
 * component of the vertex as returned by Dim4Vertex::getBoundaryComponent().
 * This is all a bit of a mess (and even more so when you consider that
 * the same thing can happen with invalid edges), but then again the
 * entire 4-manifold triangulation is invalid and so you almost certainly
 * have bigger problems to deal with.
 *
 * Boundary components are highly temporary; once a triangulation
 * changes, all its boundary component objects will be deleted and new
 * ones will be created.
