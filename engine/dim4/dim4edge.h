         * The vertices of each triangle in the edge link are
         * numbered as follows.  Following the discussion above,
         * suppose that <tt>buildLink()->getTriangle(i)</tt>
         * sits within \c pent and is parallel to
         * <tt>pent->getTriangle(e)</tt>.
         * Then vertices 0,1,2 of the triangle in the link will be

         * (the domain is a triangulation of the wrong dimension, and
         * the map is not 1-to-1 into the range pentachora).  We use

         * Instead this routine returns a pair (triangulation, isomorphism).
         * As a side-effect, the isomorphism will always be constructed
         * (i.e., it is not optional).
