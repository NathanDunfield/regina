SnapPea Kernel
--------------

This directory contains portions of the SnapPea kernel, as downloaded
from http://www.math.uic.edu/~t3m/.  This is currently synced with the
September 6, 2011 version of the SnapPea kernel, with additional patches
that convert C++-style comments into more portable C-style comments.

The SnapPeaKernel is distributed under the terms of the GNU General

SnapPea was written by Jeff Weeks <weeks@geometrygames.org>, and is now
