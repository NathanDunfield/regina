/**
 * Offers direct access to the SnapPea kernel from within Regina.
 * An object of this class represents a 3-manifold triangulation, stored
 * directly in the SnapPea kernel using SnapPea's internal format.
 *
 * Regarding interaction with the SnapPea kernel:
 *
 * - This class acts as the <b>sole C/C++ conduit</b> between the Regina
 *   calculation engine and Regina's inbuilt version of the SnapPea kernel.
 *   Regina should not interact with the SnapPea kernel at the C/C++ level
 *   other than through this class.
 *
 * - Regina can, however, interact with SnapPy at the Python level.
 *   Regina's version of the SnapPea kernel lives within a separate namespace
 *   (regina::snappea), and so there should be no conflicts between Regina's
 *   copy and SnapPy's copy of the SnapPea kernel (which may even be different
 *   versions).  You can pass triangulations back and forth between Regina and
 *   SnapPy using strings that contain the contents of a SnapPea data file
 *   (see for instance NSnapPeaTriangulation::snapPea()).
 *
 * Regarding the inherited NTriangulation interface:
 *
 * - You can happily query this object using both SnapPea functions (such as
 *   NSnapPeaTriangulation::volume(), and others specific to this class)
 *   and Regina's native triangulation functions (such as
 *   NTriangulation::getHomologyH1(), and others inherited from NTriangulation).
 *   This is because an object of this class stores \e two representations of
 *   the triangulation (SnapPea's and Regina's), which are always kept in sync.
 *
 * - However, you may <b>only edit this object using the SnapPea functions
 *   specific to this class</b> (such as NSnapPeaTriangulation::randomise()).
 *   This is essentially because the synchronisation is one-way only (from
 *   SnapPea to Regina, but not in the other direction).
 *
 * - Any attempt to edit this triangulation via the inherited NTriangulation
 *   interface (for instance, by calling NTriangulation::twoThreeMove()) will
 *   automatically cause this to become a <b>null triangulation</b>,
 *   with no tetrahedra and no SnapPea data at all.
 *
 * Null triangulations appear more generally when Regina is unable to
 * represent data in SnapPea's native format.  You can test for a
 * null triangulation by calling isNull().  Null triangulations can occur
 * for several reasons, such as (but not limited to):
 *
 * - attempting to build a SnapPea triangulation from a Regina triangulation
 *   that is invalid, has boundary faces, or has higher genus vertex
 *   links (none of which SnapPea can handle);
 *
 * - attempting to read a broken SnapPea data file;
 *
 * - attempting to change a SnapPea triangulation using the inherited
 *   NTriangulation interface (as discussed above).
 *
 * There are many places in the SnapPea kernel where SnapPea throws a
 * fatal error.  As of Regina 4.96, these fatal errors are converted
 * into exceptions (subclassed from SnapPeaException), which can be caught
 * and handled politely.
 *
 * Regina uses the variant of the SnapPea kernel that is shipped with
 * SnapPy 2.2 (standard precision), as well as some additional code
 * written explicitly for SnapPy.
 * The SnapPea kernel was written by Jeff Weeks, and SnapPy was written by
 * Marc Culler, Nathan Dunfield, and others.  SnapPy and the corresponding
 * SnapPea kernel are distributed under the terms of the GNU General
 * Public License, version 2 or any later version, as published by the
 * Free Software Foundation.
 *
 * See http://snappy.computop.org/ for further information on
 * SnapPea and its successor SnapPy.

         * You should always test isNull() to determine whether the

         *
         * Regarding the conversion:
         *
         * - If \a tri is of the subclass NSnapPeaTriangulation, then
         *   this effectively acts as a copy constructor: all
         *   SnapPea-specific information will be cloned directly
         *   through the SnapPea kernel.  If \a tri is a null SnapPea
         *   triangulation then this copy will be a null triangulation also.
         *
         * - If \a tri is of the parent class NTriangulation, then
         *   Regina will attempt to convert this triangulation to
         *   SnapPea format.  If the conversion is successful, this
         *   constructor will immediately ask SnapPea to try to find a
         *   hyperbolic structure.
         *
         * Regarding peripheral curves: native Regina triangulations do not
         * store or use peripheral curves themselves, and so this constructor
         * makes a default choice during the conversion process.  Specifically:
         *
         * - If solution_type() is geometric_solution or nongeometric_solution,
         *   then on each cusp the meridian and longitude are chosen to be the
         *   (shortest, second shortest) basis, and their orientations
         *   follow the convention used by the \e SnapPy kernel.  Be warned,
         *   however, that this choice might not be unique for some cusp shapes,
         *   and the resolution of such ambiguities might be machine-dependent.
         *
         * - If solution_type() is something else (e.g., degenerate or flat),
         *   or if SnapPea throws a fatal error when attempting to install the
         *   (shortest, second shortest) basis as described above, then Regina
         *   will accept whatever basis SnapPea installs by default.  Be warned
         *   that this default basis may change (and indeed has changed in the
         *   past) across different versions of the SnapPea kernel.
         *
         * SnapPea is designed primarily to work with ideal
         * triangulations only.  Passing closed triangulations can
         * occasionally cause the SnapPea kernel to crash the entire program.
         * Thus by default, closed triangulations are never converted (a null
         * SnapPea triangulation will be created instead).  See the optional
         * argument \a allowClosed for how to change this behaviour.
         *
         * It is possible that the tetrahedron and vertex numbers might be
         * changed in the new SnapPea triangulation.  In particular, if the
         * given Regina triangulation is orientable but not oriented, then you
         * should \e expect these numbers to change.
