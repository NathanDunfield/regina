 * A trie that stores a set of type vectors of a fixed length.
 *
 * This class forms part of the tree traversal algorithm for enumerating
 * vertex normal surfaces, as described in "A tree traversal algorithm
 * for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica (to appear), DOI 10.1007/s00453-012-9645-3.
 *
 * A type vector is a sequence of digits, each between 0 and \a nTypes-1
 * inclusive.  Type vectors are represented as arrays of characters:
 * these are not strings, but simply sequences of one-byte integers.
 * In particular, you cannot print them (since they use raw integer
 * values, not ASCII digits).  The length of a type vector must be
 * passed alongside it (i.e., there is no special terminating character).
 *
 * A type vector \a v is said to \e dominate \a u if, for each position
 * \a i, either v[i] == u[i] or else u[i] == 0.  So, for instance,
 * (1,0,2,3) dominates (1,0,2,0), which in turn dominates (1,0,0,0).
 * Domination is a partial order, not a total order: for instance,
 * neither of (1,0,2,0) or (1,0,3,0) dominates the other.
 *
 * We assume that all type vectors used in this trie have the same
 * length.  This is important, since we optimise the implementation by
 * ignoring trailing zeroes, which means that this trie cannot distinguish
 * between a vector \a v and the same vector with additional zeroes
 * appended to its end.
 *
 * Internally, each node of the trie is represented by a separate
 * TypeTrie object, each of which is responsible for managing the
 * lifespan of its descendant nodes.  Externally, a user only needs
 * to create and manage a single TypeTrie object (which becomes
 * the root of the trie).
 *
 * \pre \a nTypes is at most 256.  The typical value for \a nTypes for
 * normal surface enumeration is \a nTypes = 4.

/**
 * Stores an adjusted matrix of matching equations from the
 * underlying triangulation, in sparse form.
 *
 * This class forms part of the tree traversal algorithms for enumerating
 * and locating normal surfaces, as described in "A tree traversal algorithm
 * for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica (to appear), DOI 10.1007/s00453-012-9645-3,
 * and "A fast branching algorithm for unknot recognition with
 * experimental polynomial-time behaviour", Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079.
 *
 * The adjustments (which are all carried out in the LPInitialTableaux
 * class constructor) are as follows:
 *
 * - the rows of the matching equation matrix have been reordered so
 *   that the first rank() rows are full rank;

 * - the columns of the matching equation matrix have been reordered
 *   according to the permutation returned by columnPerm().  This is a
 *   heuristic reordering designed to improve the performance of the tree
 *   traversal algorithm; see columnPerm() for a list of constraints that
 *   such a reordering must satisfy.
 *
 * There is also optional support for adding extra linear constraints
 * (such as a constraint on Euler characteristic).  These extra
 * constraints are supplied by the template parameter \a LPConstraint,
 * and will generate LPConstraint::nConstraints additional rows and columns
 * (used by the additional variables that evaluate the corresponding linear
 * functions).  If there are no additional constraints, simply use the
 * template parameter LPConstraintNone.
 *
 * In some cases, it may be impossible to add the extra linear constraints
 * that you would like (for instance, the constraints might require some
 * preconditions on the underlying triangulation that are not met).  If this
 * is a possibility in your setting, you should call constraintsBroken() to
 * test this as soon as the LPInitialTableaux has been constructed.  Even if
 * the constraints could not be added correctly, the tableaux will be left in a
 * consistent state (the constraints will just be treated as zero functions
 * instead).
 *
 * This class is optimised for working with \e columns of the matrix
 * (in particular, multiplying columns of this matrix by rows of some
 * other matrix).
 *
 * This class can only work in quadrilateral normal coordinates
 * (NNormalSurfaceList::QUAD) or standard normal coordinates
 * (NNormalSurfaceList::STANDARD).  No other coordinate systems are
 * supported.
 *
 * \warning The implementation of this class relies on the fact that the
 * sum of <i>absolute values</i> of all coefficients in each column is
 * at most four (not counting the rows for any optional extra constraints).
 * If you are extending this class to work with more general matching
 * equation matrices, you may need to change the implementation accordingly.
 *
 * \pre The template parameter LPConstraint must be one of the subclasses of
 * LPConstraintBase.  See the LPConstraintBase class notes for further details.

         *
         * If you are imposing additional constraints through the
         * template parameter LPConstraint, then the corresponding extra
         * variables will be included in the permutation; however, these are
         * never moved and will always remain the rightmost variables in
         * this system (i.e., the columns of highest index).
         *

         * 0,...,columns()-1, this array will also adhere to the
         * following constraints.  In the following discussion, \a n refers
         * to the number of tetrahedra in the underlying triangulation.
         *
         * - The quadrilateral coordinate columns must appear as the
         *   first 3<i>n</i> columns of the adjusted matrix.
         *   In particular, when working in the 7<i>n</i>-dimensional
         *   standard coordinate system, the remaining 4<i>n</i> triangle
         *   coordinate columns must appear last.
         *
         * - The quadrilateral coordinate columns must be grouped by
         *   tetrahedron and ordered by quadrilateral type.  In other
         *   words, for each \a i = 0,...,\a n-1, there will be some
         *   tetrahedron \a j for which the three columns
         *   3<i>i</i>, 3<i>i</i>+1 and 3<i>i</i>+2 refer to the
         *   quadrilaterals in tetrahedron \a j of types 0, 1 and 2
         *   respectively.  Phrased loosely, we are allowed to reorder
         *   the tetrahedra, but not the quadrilateral coordinates
         *   within each tetrahedron.
         *
         * - The triangle coordinate columns (if we have them) must likewise
         *   be grouped by tetrahedron, and these tetrahedra must appear in
         *   the same order as for the quadrilateral types.  In other

/**
 * Stores an intermediate tableaux for the dual simplex method, and
 * contains all of the core machinery for using the dual simplex method.
 *
 * This class forms part of the tree traversal algorithms for enumerating
 * and locating normal surfaces, as described in "A tree traversal algorithm
 * for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica (to appear), DOI 10.1007/s00453-012-9645-3,
 * and "A fast branching algorithm for unknot recognition with
 * experimental polynomial-time behaviour", Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079.
 *
 * This class is designed to represent a state partway through the tree
 * traversal algorithm, where the tableaux has been altered to
 * constrain some variables:
 *
 * - Some variables have been "deactivated".  This means we fix them to
 *   zero permanently, and pretend that the corresponding columns do not
 *   exist in the matrix.  As a result, the rank of the matrix may
 *   smaller than it was when we began the tree traversal.
 *
 * - Some variables have been constrained to be positive; as described
 *   in Burton and Ozlen, it is safe to do this using the non-strict
 *   inequality x_i >= 1 (instead of the strict inequality x_i > 0, which
 *   is more difficult to enforce).  We enforce this constraing using a
 *   change of variable: we replace the variable x_i with (x_i - 1),
 *   which is then constrained to be non-negative as usual.  The new
 *   variable (x_i - 1) uses the same column in the tableaux (we perform
 *   the actual change of variable by editing the tableaux itself using
 *   column operations).  Be warned: as a result, when we arrive at a
 *   final solution and collect the values of the variables, we must
 *   remember to \e increment the values of any such variables by one.
 *
 * We do not store the full tableaux (which is dense and slow to work
 * with).  Instead we store the matrix of row operations that were
 * applied to the original starting tableaux (in the notation of Burton
 * and Ozlen, we store the matrix M_\beta^{-1}, where M is the original
 * matrix stored in the class LPInitialTableaux, and \beta is the current
 * basis).
 *
 * If the system is infeasible (because the constraints on variables as
 * described above are too severe), then the contents of the internal
 * data members are undefined (other than the data member \a feasible_,
 * which is guaranteed to be \c false).  This is because the code
 * is optimised to abort any operation as soon as infeasibility is detected,
 * which may leave the data members in a broken state.  If you are not sure,
 * you should always call isFeasible() before performing any other query
 * or operation on this tableaux.
 *
 * This class is designed to be used in a backtracking search, which
 * means the API is cumbersome but we can quickly rewrite and copy data.
 * The rules are as follows:
 *
 * - Before using an LPData object, you must reserve the necessary memory
 *   by calling reserve() and passing the original starting tableaux.
 *
 * - After this, you can reset the data by calling one of the initialisation
 *   routines initStart() or initClone(), and you can call these
 *   initialisation routines as often as you like.
 *
 * Like LPInitialTableaux, this class can enforce additional linear
 * constraints (such as positive Euler characteristic) through the template
 * parameter LPConstraint.  If there are no such constraints, simply use
 * the template parameter LPConstraintNone.
 *
 * Although the underlying coordinate system is based on quadrilaterals
 * and (optionally) triangles, this class has elementary support for
 * octagons also, as seen in \e almost normal surface theory.  For the
 * purposes of this class, an octagon is represented as a pair of
 * quadrilaterals of different types in the same tetrahedron: these meet
 * the boundary of the tetrahedron in the same arcs as a single octagon,
 * and therefore interact with the matching equations in the same way.
 *
 * To declare that you will be using octagons in some tetrahedron, you
 * must call constrainOct(quad1, quad2), where \a quad1 and \a quad2 are the
 * two corresponding quadrilateral columns.  This will have the following
 * effects, all of which may alter the tableaux:
 *
 * - There will be some changes of variable.  One of the two variables
 *   x_i will be replaced with (x_i - 1), forcing the number of octagons
 *   to be positive.  The other variable x_j will be replaced with
 *   (x_j - x_i), which will be set to zero and deactivated.  There is no
 *   guarantee as to which of the two variables \a quad1 and \a quad2
 *   will be kept and which will be deactivated: this will depend on the
 *   layout of the tableaux when constrainOct() is called.
 *
 * - If you are imposing additional constraints through the \a LPConstraint
 *   template parameter, the corresponding linear constraint functions
 *   may change their values (since the coefficients they use for
 *   octagon types need not be related to the coefficients for the two
 *   corresponding quadrilateral columns).  Any such changes are managed
 *   through the function LPConstraint::Coefficients::innerProductOct.
 *
 * This class has been optimised to ensure that you only have one
 * octagon type declared at any given time (which is consistent with the
 * constraints of almost normal surface theory).
 *
 * \pre The template parameter LPConstraint must be one of the subclasses of
 * LPConstraintBase.  See the LPConstraintBase class notes for further details.

         *   and we undo any changes of variable that were caused by
         *   calls to constrainPositive() and/or constrainOct().

         *   final vector by the smallest positive rational multiple
         *   for which all elements of the vector are integers.
         *   (This is why the output class is NRay and not NVector.)
         *
         * This routine is not used as an internal part of the tree traversal
         * algorithm; instead it is offered as a helper routine for
         * reconstructing the normal surfaces that result.
         *
         * \pre The given vector \a v has been initialised to the zero vector
         * of length origTableaux_->columns().  Note that the NRay constructor
         * will automatically initialise all elements to zero as required.

/**
 * A base class for additional banning and marking constraints that we
 * can place on tree traversal algorithms.  This is used with
 * TreeEnumeration, TreeSingleSoln and related algorithms for
 * enumerating and locating normal surfaces in a 3-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * This class adds constraints of two types:
 *
 * - \e Banning constraints, which ensure that certain normal coordinates
 *   are set to zero;
 *
 * - \e Marking constraints, which are more flexible and can be used in
 *   different ways by different algorithms.
 *
 * All of these constraints operate only on normal coordinates in the
 * underlying tableaux (and in particular not the additional variables
 * introduced by additional linear constraints, as described by
 * LPConstraintBase and its subclasses).
 *
 * Currently marking is used in the following ways:
 *
 * - The TreeEnumeration algorithm does not use marking at all.
 *
 * - In the TreeSingleSoln algorithm, marking affects what is considered
 *   a non-trivial surface.  Normally, a non-trivial surface is defined
 *   to be one in which some triangle coordinate is zero.  With marking,
 *   a non-trivial surface is redefined to be one in which some \e unmarked
 *   triangle coordinate is zero.  In other words, marked triangle types
 *   are effectively ignored when determining whether a surface is non-trivial
 *   or not.
 *
 * At present, marking is not used at all for quadrilateral coordinates.
 * Howver, marking is a very new feature, and this concept may be expanded
 * in future versions of Regina.
 *
 * This class does not record disc types in the order of their normal
 * coordinates; instead it records them in the order of their columns in
 * a tableaux for linear programming (as used in LPInitialTableaux).
 * This means that there is a little more work required in setting up
 * the initial lists of banned and marked columns, but then these lists are
 * easy to use on the fly during tree traversal algorithms.
 *
 * This base class provides limited functionality (as documented below).
 * Subclasses \e must implement a constructor (which, like this base
 * class, takes a triangulation and a coordinate system), and must also
 * implement the routine init() which determines which normal coordinates
 * are banned and/or marked.

/**
 * A base class for searches that employ the tree traversal algorithm for
 * enumerating and locating vertex normal surfaces.  Users should not use this
 * base class directly; instead use one of the subclasses TreeEnumeration (for
 * enumerating all vertex normal surfaces) or TreeSingleSoln (for
 * locating a single non-trivial solution under additional constraints,
 * such as positive Euler characteristic).
 *
 * The full algorithms are described respectively in "A tree traversal
 * algorithm for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica (to appear), DOI 10.1007/s00453-012-9645-3,
 * and "A fast branching algorithm for unknot recognition with
 * experimental polynomial-time behaviour", Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079.
 *
 * This base class provides the infrastructure for the search tree, and the
 * subclasses handle the mechanics of the moving through the tree according
 * to the backtracking search.  The domination test is handled separately by
 * the class TypeTrie, and the feasibility test is handled separately by the
 * class LPData.
 *
 * This class holds the particular state of the tree traversal
 * at any point in time, as described by the current \e level (indicating
 * our current depth in the search tree) and <i>type vector</i>
 * (indicating which branches of the search tree we have followed).
 * For details on these concepts, see the Algorithmica paper cited above.
 * The key details are summarised below; throughout this discussion
 * \a n represents the number of tetrahedra in the underlying triangulation.
 *
 * - In quadrilateral coordinates, the type vector is a sequence of \a n
 *   integers, each equal to 0, 1, 2 or 3, where the <i>i</i>th integer
 *   describes the choice of quadrilateral location in the <i>i</i>th
 *   tetrahedron.
 *
 * - In standard coordinates, the type vector begins with the \a n
 *   quadrilateral choices outlined above.  This is then followed by an
 *   additional 4<i>n</i> integers, each equal to 0 or 1; these
 *   correspond to the 4<i>n</i> triangle coordinates, and indicate
 *   whether each coordinate is zero or non-zero.
 *
 * In the original Algorithmica paper, we choose types in the order
 * type_[0], type_[1] and so on, working from the root of the tree down
 * to the leaves.  Here we support a more flexible system: there is an
 * internal permutation \a typeOrder_, and we choose types in the order
 * type_[typeOrder_[0]], type_[typeOrder_[1]] and so on.  This
 * permutation may mix quadrilateral and triangle processing, and may
 * even change as the algorithm runs.
 *
 * This class can also support octagon types in almost normal surfaces.
 * However, we still do our linear programming in standard or quadrilateral
 * coordinates, where we represent an octagon using two conflicting 
 * quadrilaterals in the same tetrahedron (which meet the tetrahedron boundary
 * in the same set of arcs as a single octagon would).  As with the almost
 * normal coordinate systems in NNormalSurfaceList, we allow multiple octagons
 * of the same type, but only one octagon type in the entire tetrahedron.
 * In the type vector, octagons are indicated by setting a quadrilateral
 * type to 4, 5 or 6.
 *
 * There is optional support for adding extra linear constraints
 * (such as a constraint on Euler characteristic), supplied by the
 * template parameter \a LPConstraint.  If there are no additional
 * constraints, simply use the template parameter LPConstraintNone.
 *
 * Also, there is optional support for banning normal disc types (so the
 * corresponding coordinates must be set to zero), and/or marking normal
 * disc types (which currently affects what is meant by a "non-trivial"
 * surface for the TreeSingleSoln algorithm, though this concept may be
 * expanded in future versions of Regina).  These options are supplied
 * by the template parameter \a BanConstraint.  If there are no disc
 * types to ban or mark, simply use the template parameter \a BanNone.
 *
 * In some cases, it is impossible to add the extra linear constraints
 * that we would like (for instance, if they require additional
 * preconditions on the underlying triangulation).  If this is a possibility
 * in your setting, you should call constraintsBroken() to test for this
 * once the TreeTraversal object has been constructed.
 *
 * \pre The parameters LPConstraint and BanConstraint must be subclasses of
 * LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase respectively.  See the
 * LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase class notes for further details.

/**
 * The main entry point for the tree traversal algorithm to enumerate all
 * vertex normal or almost normal surfaces in a 3-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * This class essentially implements the algorithm from "A tree traversal
 * algorithm for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica (to appear), DOI 10.1007/s00453-012-9645-3.
 *
 * To enumerate all vertex surfaces for a given 3-manifold
 * triangulation, simply construct a TreeTraversal object and call run().
 *
 * Alternatively, you can have more fine-grained control over the search.
 * Instead of calling run(), you can construct a TreeTraversal object and
 * repeatedly call next() to step through each vertex surface one at
 * a time.  This allows you to pause and resume the search as you please.
 *
 * If you simply wish to detect a single non-trivial solution under
 * additional constraints (such as positive Euler characteristic), then
 * use the class TreeSingleSoln instead, which is optimised for this purpose.
 *
 * This tree traversal can only enumerate surfaces in quadrilateral normal
 * coordinates (NNormalSurfaceList::QUAD), standard normal coordinates
 * (NNormalSurfaceList::STANDARD), quadrilateral-octagon almost normal
 * coordinates (NNormalSurfaceList::AN_QUAD_OCT), or standard almost
 * normal coordinates (NNormalSurfaceList::AN_STANDARD).  For almost
 * normal surfaces, we allow any number of octagons (including zero),
 * but we only allow at most one octagon \e type in the entire triangulation.
 * No coordinate systems other than these are supported.
 *
 * By using appropriate template parameters \a LPConstraint and/or
 * \a BanConstraint, it is possible to impose additional linear
 * constraints on the normal surface solution cone, and/or explicitly force
 * particular normal coordinates to zero.  In this case, the notion of
 * "vertex surface" is modified to mean a normal surface whose coordinates
 * lie on an extreme ray of the restricted solution cone under these additional
 * constraints (and whose coordinates are integers with no common divisor).
 * See the LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase class notes for
 * details.
 *
 * \pre The parameters LPConstraint and BanConstraint must be subclasses of
 * LPConstraintSubspace and BanConstraintBase respectively.  Note in
 * particular that the base class LPConstraintBase is not enough here.
 * See the LPConstraintBase, LPConstraintSubspace and BanConstraintBase
 * class notes for further details.
 *
 * \warning Although the tree traversal algorithm can run in standard
 * normal or almost normal coordinates, this is not recommended: it is likely
 * to be \e much slower than in quadrilateral or quadrilateral-octagon
 * coordinates respectively.  Instead you should enumerate vertex
 * solutions using quadrilateral or quadrilateral-octagon coordinates, and
 * then run the conversion procedure NNormalSurfaceList::quadToStandard()
 * or NNormalSurfaceList::quadOctToStandardAN().

/**
 * The main entry point for the tree traversal / branching algorithm to locate
 * a single non-trivial normal surface satisfying given constraints within
 * a 3-manifold triangulation.  The constraints are passed using a
 * combination of the template arguments LPConstraint and BanConstraint.
 *
 * A common application of this algorithm is to find a surface of positive
 * Euler characteristic, using the template argument LPConstraintEuler.
 * This is useful for tasks such as 0-efficiency testing
 * and prime decomposition (when this is done in standard normal coordinates),
 * and also 3-sphere recognition (when this is done in standard almost normal
 * coordinates).  Indeed, the underlying algorithm is optimised for
 * precisely this application.
 *
 * By a "non-trivial" surface, we mean that at least one triangle coordinate
 * is zero.  Philosophically this is to avoid vertex linking surfaces,
 * though if the triangulation has more than one vertex then this takes
 * on a different meaning.  See the warning on this matter below.
 *
 * Be warned that this routine does not eliminate the zero vector, and so
 * the template argument LPConstraint should include at least one
 * constraint that eliminates the zero vector (e.g., positive Euler
 * characteristic).  Otherwise this algorithm may simply return the zero
 * vector, and the information gained will not be very useful.
 *
 * For any given normal coordinate, this routine will always try setting
 * that coordinate to zero before it tries setting it to non-zero.  In
 * other words, if it does find a surface satisfying the given constraints,
 * then it is guaranteed that the set of non-zero coordinate positions
 * will be minimal (though not necessary a global \e minimum).
 * In many settings (such as when using LPConstraintEuler), this guarantees
 * that the final surface (if it exists) will be a vertex normal or
 * almost normal surface.
 *
 * The underlying algorithm is described in "A fast branching algorithm for
 * unknot recognition with experimental polynomial-time behaviour",
 * Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079, and uses significant material from
 * "A tree traversal algorithm for decision problems in knot theory and
 * 3-manifold topology", Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica (to appear),
 * DOI 10.1007/s00453-012-9645-3.
 *
 * To use this class, i.e., to locate a non-trivial normal or almost normal
 * surface under the given constraints or to prove that no such surface exists,
 * you can simply construct a TreeSingleSoln object and call find().  You can
 * then call buildSurface() to extract the details of the surface that was
 * found.
 *
 * If you wish to enumerate \e all vertex surfaces in a 3-manifold
 * triangulation (instead of finding just one), you should use the class
 * TreeEnumeration instead.
 *
 * This tree traversal can only enumerate surfaces in quadrilateral normal
 * coordinates (NNormalSurfaceList::QUAD), standard normal coordinates
 * (NNormalSurfaceList::STANDARD), quadrilateral-octagon almost normal
 * coordinates (NNormalSurfaceList::AN_QUAD_OCT), or standard almost
 * normal coordinates (NNormalSurfaceList::AN_STANDARD).  For almost
 * normal surfaces, we allow any number of octagons (including zero),
 * but we only allow at most one octagon \e type in the entire triangulation.
 * No coordinate systems other than these are supported.
 *
 * \warning Typically one should only use this class with \e one-vertex
 * triangulations (since otherwise, setting at least one triangle coordinate
 * to zero is not enough to rule out trivial vertex linking surfaces).
 * Of course there may be settings in which multiple vertices make sense
 * (for instance, in ideal triangulations with multiple cusps, or when
 * using ban constraints), and in such settings this class will still work
 * precisely as described.
 * 
 * \warning If you examine the type vector (for instance, by calling
 * dumpTypes()), be aware that this class merges the old types 0 and 1
 * together into a single branch of the search tree.  This means that
 * type 0 never appears, and that type 1 could indicate \e either positive
 * quadrilaterals in the first position, or else no quadrilaterals at all.
 *
 * \pre The parameters LPConstraint and BanConstraint must be subclasses of
 * LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase respectively.  See the
 * LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase class notes for further details.
